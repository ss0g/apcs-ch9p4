Write an inheritance hierarchy to model items at a library. Include books,
magazines, journal articles, videos, and electronic media such as CDs. Include
in a superclass and/or interface common information that the library must have
for every item, such as a unique identification number and title. Place
behavior and information that is specific to items, such as a video's runtime
length or a CD's musical genre, into the subclasses.
